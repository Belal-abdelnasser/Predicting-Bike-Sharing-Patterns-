# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns
In this project, I build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, Implementing and better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch.
